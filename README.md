## Scaling Ethereum 2021 submission

When joining the scaling ethereum hackathon there were several resources to get started.

[Scaling Ethereum Website](http://scaling.ethglobal.co/)

[Scaling Ethereum Info Center](https://www.notion.so/ethglobal/Scaling-Ethereum-Info-Center-8f58d533a58446e498d2bf23e1c84f2e)

There was a long list of vendors to hack on with over $200k+ in prizes to be awarded

Shortly after joining the hackathon I received an invite to apply as a mentor with [Skale](https://skale.network/). For anyone not familiar, Skale enables provisioning an ethereum compatible side chain to deploy dapps which can handle fast and free/low cost transactions to end users.

I figured I know a thing or two about building and deploying dapps. I have experience with Skale. Sure why not, let me submit an application. A few days after submitting my application an email arrived from Skale congratulating me on being accepted as a technical mentor at ETH Global Scaling Ethereum. How exciting.

And so I was in a situation where I would be mentoring while also committing to a project for the good of the community. Hmmm ðŸ¤” what should I submit?

## The Problem
Interacting with Ethereum main net today is prohibitively high priced and relatively slow. A transaction could take on average 15 seconds to several days or more to get accepted into a block. A transaction could cost in the $100's of dollars to execute.

## The Solution
L2 aka Layer 2. A promising list of sponsors in the ETH Global Scaling Ethereum hackathon are building the solutions. Rollups, Interchain messaging, Fast Finality, ZK Snarks, Starks, Sparks, and all the other buzz words are going to solve the problems users have been encountering on main net.

## Exercise / Submission
For this Hackathon I set my sights on Skale. My game plan is follow some simple steps to try out the technology.

1. Research Skale's on boarding documentation
2. Provision a Skale Chain
3. Deploy a hello world solidity contract
4. If time permits, deploy an old game I built "Proof of Snek"

Too Easy
